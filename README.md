# About 

AILT is a Linux terminal tool powered by AI. It allows you to issue commands in natural language, which it can execute on your system. Designed primarily as a learning tool and assistant, AILT is intended to support your workflow rather than replace your controlâ€”users should remain the main driver while relying on AILT as a helper.

  <strong>Note:</strong> This is an alpha testing prototype. AILT provides the freedom to use third-party LLM models and does not control their responses. AILT serves solely as an interface and is provided "as-is" without any guarantees. While the tool itself is designed to be safe, its usage depends on user practices and command execution. The developers do not assume any responsibility or liability for its use.

## Usage Example

You can interact with AILT using natural language commands. For example, to get the first line from a file named `secret.txt`, you can type:

```bash
AI: Get me the first line from secret.txt
```

AILT will interpret your request, run the necessary Linux command, and return the output automatically.
